// Shared "liquid glass" recipe — used by both the Tailwind/TSX
// LiquidGlassCard (Home page cards) and the inline-style NavMenu
// dropdown panel, so tuning the glass look only ever happens here.
//
// Matches the reference liquid-glass-button spec: no background tint,
// no extra fallback blur layered on top of the SVG filter — the glass
// look comes entirely from the backdrop distortion + the inset "lens"
// shadow below it. Safari doesn't support the SVG url() filter
// reference inside backdrop-filter at all, so its -webkit- prefixed
// property falls back to a plain blur (no distortion in Safari — a
// real browser limitation) rather than showing nothing.
